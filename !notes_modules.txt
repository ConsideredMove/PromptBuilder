B1: Lineness versus color saturation? <Lineness, larger, brighter > realism, smaller

--- APG: 
Defaults: 1.5 / 0.18 / 15 / 1
5.42 / 0.28

APG's now your CFG - After many test generations, I feel this extension improves the overall image coherence. I have all the settings set to default except APG Norm Threshold which was changed to 25. [Not used for V-pred models]

___ SKIMMEDCFG:
Dual scales 3/7 is pretty nice.


--- LatentModifer:
Noise ~3 without checkbox? With it seems like it is ineffective.
Dyncfg - third option interesting!

Combat cfg drift (sharpen) increases brightness. Phi causes a noise crash around 1. Otherwise reduces contrast.

Sharpness 6 aniso + Adv 8 / 0?
20 c / 5 1
18 c / 255 0

Divisive norm multiplier best at 0, otherwise details blget samaged



Cfg drift - brightness
Cfg pi - -*contrast

Cfg drift 0-1 on subtract seems to help brightness.

Cfg: Brightness
Cfg: Wacky colors <> grey noise mush

Subtract = darkest
Channels = brighter
Median = balanced

Sharpness can be 18 with 255 divisive norm + otherwise use 12

Final
15 sharpness c, 
Tonemap 0.75 spatial,
Divisive normalization yes,
Halfcosine-mimic

Divisive norm 1/1 changea the image, but better suppresses noise artifacts.

Cfgimic tonemap has interesting lighting.
