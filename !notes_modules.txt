B1: Lineness versus color saturation? <Lineness, larger, brighter > realism, smaller
B2: Makes things worse if not 1.
S1: < Size difference, saturation

APG's now your CFG - After many test generations, I feel this extension improves the overall image coherence. I have all the settings set to default except APG Norm Threshold which was changed to 25. [Not used for V-pred models]

___ SKIMMEDCFG:
Dual scales 3/7 is pretty nice.


--- LatentModifer:
Noise ~3 without checkbox? With it seems like it is ineffective.
Dyncfg - third option interesting!

Combat cfg drift (sharpen) increases brightness. Phi causes a noise crash around 1. Otherwise reduces contrast.
